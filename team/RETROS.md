## Retro Assessment

- What retro outline or process you used?  
  => I used Start/Stop/Continue template to lead the retro. All the team members were asked to write one thing they want to stop, start, or continue at the beggining of the session. Then, we disccused those ideas amongst each other.
- How it went?  
  => It was a productive session that helped all the team members be more comfortable about sharing ideas with each other.
- What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?  
  => Make sure you covered everything that needs to be discussed within the team.
