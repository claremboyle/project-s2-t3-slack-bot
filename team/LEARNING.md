# Current Familiarity
  #no team members have a good understanding of any of the Next.js necessary tech
  #team members have a light understanding of JS and general software dev (no one needs their hand held while learning)
  
# Proposals to Learn Necessary Skills
  *week 3: all team members go over necessary tech for Next.js to have a familiarity with it, then tweak as necessary and focus on:
    *Alan: JSX, SlackAPI front end (slack side)
    #Kouroh: JSX, React front end (webpage settings)
    #Tommy: JSX, SlackAPI back end 
    #Adarsha: JSX, MongoDB
